# Advent of Code

My solutions for the Advent of Code.

## 2022

No experiments this year. I'm using python and try to keep it simple and
intuitive. I'm mostly interested in starting with clean datastructures for
part-one and concentrate on doing abstractions that will allow me easily to
adopt for part-two.

Since this isn't my first rodeo, I have a small boilerplate in `day00.py` that
I use as a base to be directly able to jump in hacking together a solution
every day.
